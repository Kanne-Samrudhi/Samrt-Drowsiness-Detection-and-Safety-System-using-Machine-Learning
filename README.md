# Problem Statement-
This project introduces an intelligent system aimed at addressing drowsy driving, a major cause of road accidents. Utilizing advanced image processing techniques like facial recognition and eye tracking, the system continuously monitors the driver's facial cues and eye movements in real-time. Algorithms such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is employed for efficient processing.
Upon detecting signs of drowsiness, proactive measures are taken, including playing upbeat music or issuing alerts, using machine learning algorithms or deep learning models for severity classification.
Furthermore, the system integrates a speed brake detection module using computer vision algorithms like edge detection and Hough transform to identify obstacles on the road. In critical situations, it employs geolocation algorithms to determine the driver's location and sends distress signals, such as SOS messages, to predefined emergency contacts.
Overall, by combining cutting-edge algorithms and approaches, this system offers a comprehensive solution to mitigate the risks associated with drowsy driving in real-time, significantly enhancing road safety standards.
